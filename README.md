# Fibonacci-a-few-ways
#
# Simple functions to calculate fibonacci numbers using for, while and recursion

# Recall that the fibonacci sequence is a sequence that is usually recursively defined, 
# but it does have a closed-form
# forfib, listrecfib & whilefib methods produce lists
# recfib produce a scalar, and lisrecfib calls recfib
# I plan to add to calculation of time
