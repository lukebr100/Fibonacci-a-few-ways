# Simple functions to calculate fibonacci numbers using for, while and recursion. Recall that the fibonacci sequence is a sequence that is usually recursively defined, but it does have a closed-form.
# forfib, recfib & whilefib methods produce lists. There are functions that compute run time, and I plan to make visualizations.
